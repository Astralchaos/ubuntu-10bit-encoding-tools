Run install.sh to install the scripts into /usr/local/bin and compile the encoding tools.
Note: You may recompile the tools at any time by running 'encode-compile'

Simply cd to the directory of your files to process and type the name of one of the encoding scripts.
It's a pretty good idea to string scripts together with ';'.
Example: encode-audio; encode-video-crf18; encode-merge

Here are the following commands you may use:

encode-audio # transcodes the audio in videos into Opus audio.
encode-compile # compiles/recompiles the encoding tools.
encode-git-update # downloads the latest git version and recompiles encoding tools.
encode-merge # merges encoded/transcoded files into a MKV container.
encode-music # transcodes music files into Opus audio.
encode-video-crf14
encode-video-crf16
encode-video-crf18
encode-video-crf20
encode-video-crf24

The encode-video scripts all use Level 5.2 Placebo parameters for the best compression/quality.

I'll keep this git updated for as long as I can with all the latest and greatest encoding technologies.
