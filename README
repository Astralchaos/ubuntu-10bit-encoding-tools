Run install.sh to install the scripts into /usr/local/bin and compile the encoding tools.
Note: You may recompile the tools at any time by running 'encode-compile'

Simply cd to the directory of your files to process and type the name of one of the encoding scripts.
It's a pretty good idea to string together the scripts using ';'.
Example: encode-audio-stereo; encode-video-crf18; encode-merge

Here are the following commands you may use:

encode-audio-stereo
encode-audio-surround
encode-compile
encode-merge
encode-music
encode-video-crf18
encode-video-crf20
encode-video-crf24
