Run install.sh to install the scripts into /usr/local/bin and compile the encoding tools.
Note: You may recompile the tools at any time by running 'encode-compile'

Simply cd to the directory of your files to process and type the name of one of the encoding scripts.
It's a pretty good idea to string scripts together with ';'.
Example: encode-audio-stereo; encode-video-crf18; encode-merge

Here are the following commands you may use:

encode-audio-stereo
encode-audio-surround
encode-compile
encode-merge
encode-music 
encode-video-crf18
encode-video-crf20
encode-video-crf24

The encode-video scripts all use Level 5.2 Placebo parameters for the best compression/quality.
The encode-music script transcodes music files into 96kbps HE-AAC M4A files.
The encode-audio-stereo transcodes the audio in videos into 96kbps HE-AAC AAC files.
The encode-audio-surround transcodes the audio in videos into 160kbps HE-AAC AAC files.
The encode-merge script merges the transcoded AAC audio files, any attachments of the original video, and the encoded 10-bit H.264 file into a new, completed encode.
