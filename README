Run install.sh to install the scripts into /usr/local/bin and compile the encoding tools.

Simply cd to the directory of your files to process and type the name of one of the encoding scripts.
It's a pretty good idea to string scripts together with ';'.
Example: cd ~/Videos/Encode/Node01; encode-audio; encode-video 18; encode-merge
Example2: cd ~/Music/Encode; encode-music

Here are the following commands you may use:

encode-audio # transcodes the audio in videos into Opus audio.
encode-compile # compiles/recompiles the encoding tools.
encode-git-update # downloads the latest git version and recompiles encoding tools.
encode-merge # merges encoded/transcoded files into a MKV container.
encode-music # transcodes music files into Opus audio.
encode-video $CRF # Encodes videos to level 5.2 Placebo parameters for the best compression/quality. Replace $CRF with the CRF value you wish to use.
encode-video-parallel $CRF # Encodes two videos in parallel for optimal CPU usage

I'll keep this git updated for as long as I can with all the latest and greatest encoding technologies.

-- NOTICE --
Currently, only mpv can play MKVs with Opus audio correctly.
